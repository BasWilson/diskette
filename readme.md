# Diskette ðŸ’¾

This is a fun thing I made when I was stuck in a tent on a rainy holiday with 2kb/s internet speed.

I decided to make a local 'drive' called diskette. Users can create an account and they will get their own _diskette that stores their content.

This is probably the most insecure thing ever made but it was a fun way to learn more about the FS library for node. It was never finished and I don't intend on finishing it.

Give it a try if you want. 

```
git clone https://github.com/BasWilson/diskette.git
cd diskette
npm install
npm run start
```
